Talus
=====

Talus is a distributed virtualized tool framework that is intended to ease
the running of and result collection of tools in virtualized environments.

Generally speaking, talus has two main components:

1. Master
2. Slave(s)

Talus users interact with Talus via ``git`` and the :ref:`talus_client`.

Master
------

The Talus master is responsible for managing the slaves and processing
commands from the user.

The master is made up of three main parts:

1. Web API
2. RabbitMQ AMQP
3. MongoDB
4. Master Daemon

Clients interact with Talus via the Web API, which only makes changes to the
MongoDB database.
