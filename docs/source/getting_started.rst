Overview
--------

Talus is a framework for running tools inside VMs and getting the results back
out. Talus attempts to simplify the interactions needed between the user and the
framework in order to accomplish this task.

In most cases, a user would only need the Talus client, a text editor, and git
in order to use Talus.
